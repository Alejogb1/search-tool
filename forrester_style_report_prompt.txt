Act as a senior market analyst at a top-tier research firm like Forrester or Gartner. Your task is to write a comprehensive, 2000-word strategic report analyzing the customer search landscape for `{DOMAIN_NAME}`, a company that provides `{PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION}` for `{TARGET_AUDIENCE}`. Your analysis must be based on the provided search keyword cluster data in `{CLUSTERS_CSV_PATH}`. The final output should be a formal, data-driven essay in Markdown format, following the structure of a Forrester Wave report where you evaluate the strategic importance of customer search clusters instead of vendors. Your analysis must include the following sections: 1. **Executive Summary:** Start with a concise summary of the most critical findings and strategic recommendations, stating the primary conclusion of the report upfront. 2. **Key Search Market Trends:** Identify and elaborate on 3-4 macro trends in how customers are searching within the `{INDUSTRY}` space, drawing evidence from the themes and terms in the cluster data and discussing the implications for `{DOMAIN_NAME}`. 3. **Search Opportunity Evaluation Summary:** Conceptually describe a "Search Opportunity Wave" graphic that categorizes clusters into "Leaders," "Strong Performers," "Contenders," and "Niche Opportunities" based on their market opportunity (volume, commercial intent) and strategic fit. Also, describe a "Search Opportunity Scorecard" that provides detailed scoring for each cluster against weighted criteria. 4. **Search Cluster Profiles:** Profile at least two "Leader" clusters and two "Strong Performer" clusters. For each, detail its description, strengths (volume, intent, strategic fit), weaknesses (competition, ambiguity), and overall strategic importance, using specific data points from the CSV file. 5. **Strategic Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, provide at least three distinct, actionable recommendations covering content strategy, SEO priorities, and paid media allocation. Each recommendation must be justified by specific findings from the cluster analysis. 6. **Conclusion:** Conclude by summarizing the report and reiterating the most critical strategic takeaway for `{DOMAIN_NAME}` to succeed in the current search landscape. Throughout the report, maintain a formal, authoritative tone, cite specific data points (e.g., search volumes, representative terms) from the cluster data to support every claim, and ensure the total length is approximately 2000 words.
