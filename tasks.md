### Phase 1: Foundation & Data Ingestion Pipeline

- [ ] **1.1: Environment & Database Setup**
    - [ ] Provision a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    - [ ] Design and deploy the database schema (`domains`, `keywords`, `clusters`, `reports`).
    - [X] Set up a version-controlled repository (Git).
    - [ ] Implement a basic CI/CD pipeline.

- [ ] **1.2: External API Integration Module**
    - [ ] Develop a resilient client for the LLM API (error handling, retries, rate limits).
    - [ ] **[BLOCKED]** Develop a client for the Google Ads API.
    - [ ] Implement a mock/stubbed Google Ads API service for parallel development.

- [ ] **1.3: Initial Domain Analysis & Seed Keyword Generation**
    - [X] Create a web scraping utility to extract text content from a domain URL.
    - [X] Develop an LLM prompt chain to generate seed keywords from scraped text.
    - [X] Create the logic to store seed keywords in the database, linked to the domain.

### Phase 2: Core Processing & Intelligence Layer

- [ ] **2.1: Keyword Expansion & Enrichment**
    - [ ] Integrate the Google Ads API client to expand the seed keyword list.
    - [ ] Fetch key metrics (avg. monthly searches, competition, CPC) for each keyword.
    - [ ] Implement logic to bulk-save the expanded keywords and their metrics to the database.

- [ ] **2.2: NLP-driven Keyword Clustering**
    - [ ] Integrate a sentence-embedding model to generate vectors for each keyword.
    - [ ] Implement a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means, HDBSCAN) to group keywords.
    - [ ] Develop an LLM prompt to generate a human-readable name/theme for each cluster.
    - [ ] Store cluster information and link keywords to their respective clusters in the database.

- [ ] **2.3: Knowledge Signal Extraction**
    - [ ] Design LLM prompts to analyze clusters for strategic insights.
    - [ ] Implement logic to tag clusters as "Use Cases", "Features", "Competitors", etc.
    - [ ] Update the cluster records in the database with these knowledge signal tags.

### Phase 3: API Development & Delivery

- [ ] **3.1: API Endpoint Definition & Implementation**
    - [ ] Set up a FastAPI application.
    - [ ] Implement `POST /v1/analyze` endpoint to start an asynchronous job.
    - [ ] Implement `GET /v1/report/{job_id}` endpoint to check status and retrieve results.
    - [ ] Integrate an asynchronous task queue (e.g., Celery).

- [ ] **3.2: Report Generation Logic**
    - [ ] Create the logic to query all processed data for a completed job ID from the database.
    - [ ] Define and implement the final, structured JSON report format using Pydantic schemas.
    - [ ] Ensure the `GET /v1/report/{job_id}` endpoint returns the structured report.

### Phase 4: Validation, Deployment & Documentation

- [ ] **4.1: Quality Assurance & Validation**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for individual modules (clients, services, repositories).
    - [ ] Write integration tests for the entire asynchronous pipeline.
    - [ ] Perform end-to-end validation with a set of diverse test domains.

- [ ] **4.2: Deployment & Monitoring**
    - [ ] Containerize the application using Docker (`Dockerfile`).
    - [ ] Create a `docker-compose.yml` for local development (app, db, worker, message broker).
    - [ ] Deploy the containerized application to a cloud service (e.g., AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run).
    - [ ] Implement structured logging across the application.
    - [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for API performance and costs.

- [ ] **4.3: API Documentation**
    - [ ] Auto-generate interactive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger.
    - [ ] Write a supplementary guide (`README.md` or wiki page) explaining how to interpret the report.
    - [ ] Document all environment variables and setup procedures for future developers.
