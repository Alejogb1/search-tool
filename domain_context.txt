We call him Arcturus.
---------------------

SkyPlanner APS has built-in artificial intelligence that calculates complex production plans in seconds. We know him as Arcturus. Arcturus will seamlessly connect production data from your [ERP](https://skyplanner.ai/resources/what-is-erp/) or [MES system](https://skyplanner.ai/resources/mes-system-what-it-is-and-what-it-does/) to priorities set by production planners. The AI in SkyPlanner APS reacts to continuous changes in production and keeps production optimized. Just like a GPS navigator calculates a route.

#### Arcturus AI and production scheduling

The AI in SkyPlanner APS is designed to calculate the most optimal production plan fast. It also maintains production on an optimal level while reacting to changes automatically. Arcturus tells us in which order the tasks in a factory should be completed based on production data from your ERP system, the capacity of workstations, time logging, materials, set priorities, etc.

![Image 197](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_542+h_315+ret_img/skyplanner.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Arcturus-AI-card-image.svg)

#### Humans guiding AI

Humans can easily limit and free up the power of Arcturus AI when needed. Humans set goals and priorities that the AI takes into account in the production scheduling process. Guiding Arcturus AI is fast and easy through a modern user interface. This means that when humans are using AI, they won’t stop thinking, but they actually start thinking.

![Image 199](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_542+h_315+ret_img/skyplanner.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-Skyplanner-works-card-image.svg)

#### How Skyplanner can help

SkyPlanner APS ensures that your facility works to its fullest capacity. Factories that are using SkyPlanner APS save an enormous amount of time and resources. Optimizing production plans after every single change can be frustrating and inefficient.

Title: Autonomous Resilient Supply Chain Planning

URL Source: https://deepvu.co/

Markdown Content:
**Resilience**
--------------

Resilient planning substantially impacts your company’s key CFO-level metrics including BoM cost, time-to-market, inventory holding costs, expedited freight costs, OTIF penalties, energy costs, labor costs, stockout events and missed revenue, emissions and sustainability.

#### We're committed to building and enabling a sustainable, resilient future that protects both the quality of life for humanity and the planet.

Give your planners AI superpowers to navigate supply chain risks & optimize intelligently.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Shock-Resilient

Forecasting models alone have been failing to deliver true resilience, as they get thrown with every new shock that breaks historical patterns!

DeepVu's Solution: DeepVu's AI decisioning Agents are trained on top of digital twins that simulate normal scenario, shock scenario-A, shock scenario-B etc that recommend actions to optimize for your business KPIs. The human planner selects which Agent is pertinent and the corresponding action most applicable to today’s scenario in that specific market/geo.

### Generative & Autonomous

With traditional planning, humans make all recurring decisions, which is error prone, has long lead times, and the impact on KPIs is delayed or never evaluated.

DeepVu's Solution: Leverage multi-agent Generative AI decisioning Agents to make intelligent planning decisions that learn from historical human decisions, and improve upon them as they get smarter over time with usage and human feedback. The impact of each generated action on the business KPIs is imediately available.

### Sustainable

Annual marketing oriented sustainability reports are neither granular nor an accurate account of a company’s supply chain emissions.

DeepVu's Solution: DeepVu takes sustainability as one of the business KPIs for which the AI decisioning Agents are optimizing. The weight of the KPI is per each customer’s requirement. Hence the impact of each decision on sustainability metrics is readily available in the logs and aggregated quarterly for full transparency and accuracy in compliance reports.

### Rich Data

Traditional shallow forecasting, such as ARIMA and basic ML forecasting, fall short in leveraging hundreds of important external signals.

DeepVu's Solution: Enrich your internal forecasting models with a rich industry and global context by leverag\ ing ever-growing supply chain knowledge graphs that incorporate hundreds of external signals that capture shocks as they emerge.

### Collaborative

Integrating a B2B enterprise platform into your existing work flow can be a time-consuming and challenging process.

DeepVu's Solution: Our platform is sold as SaaS subscription "à la carte" per use case, and seamlessly integrates with any legacy or ERP system using cloud APIs, or used via a beautiful dashboard to boost planner’s productivity and effectiveness.

![Image 1](https://deepvu.co/img/real-time-vector.svg)

### Real Time

Get insights and actionable shock resilient decisions in real-time. DeepVu analyzes data streams of the external signals as they arrive which enriches the decisioning Agents with current global context.

![Image 2](https://deepvu.co/img/deep-learning-vector.svg)

### Generative AI/DRL

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is the most advanced, scalable, self-tuning type of Generative AI decisioning Agents. Handles complexities and scale that traditional machine-learning cannot.

![Image 3](https://deepvu.co/img/full-stack-vector.svg)

A versatile resilient planning solution capable of handling any supply chain data-set and use-case including demand planning, order fulfillment, auto-replenishment, production planning, and freight.

![Image 4](https://deepvu.co/img/scalable-dot-vector.svg)

### Scalable

No feature-engineering work or thousands of rule updates needed. DeepVu's models will scale up as your company scales to new products, SKUs, fulfillment centers, and markets.

Discover crucial external macro & micro indicators that impact your supply chain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlock invaluable insights by utilizing DeepVu's supply chain knowledge graphs (VuGraph),

which include hundreds of external signals with their predictive weights. These signals range

from macro and microeconomics to commodity prices, and global trade metrics.

By identifying the most impactful signals and integrating them into your model,

you can substantially improve the accuracy of your forecasting.

Sustainability: Did you know?
-----------------------------

Eight supply chains are responsible for more than 51% of global emissions (source: World Economic Forum 2024)

Moreover, supply chain emissions are 11.4 times higher than operational emissions (source: CDP Report 2020).

Climate disruptions have become the new norm. All manufacturers are experiencing adverse effects as a result of

supply chain challenges exacerbated by ongoing shocks. Over the past decade, big companies started talking

about connected planning and integrated planning, but none of these approaches could deliver true resilience.

Now is the time for a revolutionary shift towards resilient autonomous sustainable supply chain planning, ensuring

long-term sustainability for both businesses and the planet.
