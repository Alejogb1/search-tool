Hi {{ contact_first_name }},

Thanks for the quick reply. I completely understand the role fit.

Your response made me realize something: I'm currently building a market intelligence tool that could be perfect for companies like {{ company_name }}. I use Google search data to uncover hidden opportunities in niche tech markets.

I'm creating an automated market intelligence platform that:
- Processes millions of Google searches using NLP clustering (https://github.com/Alejogb1/search-tool)
- Uses transformer models to analyze search semantics (GPT = Generative Pretrained Transformer)
- Identifies hidden opportunities in technical domains
- Replaces manual market research (like what McKinsey charges $200k for) or CB insights or what Palantir does (pattern recognition in complex data)
Think of it as "Market analysis for deep tech"

So I would map clusters of Google Search term data to show where your tech solves unaddressed needs (look at the attached PDF)

This isn't a pitch; I'd genuinely like to run this analysis for you at no cost. You'd get the first look at any interesting patterns I find. I think it could be useful for your product/market strategy.

Either way, appreciate you considering my earlier inquiry!

Best,
{{ your_name }}
