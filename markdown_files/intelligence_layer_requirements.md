# Fundamental Requirements for Intelligence Layer Data Analysis

## Objective
Develop a sophisticated intelligence layer that transforms raw keyword data into strategic insights through multi-dimensional analysis. The system must identify market opportunities, competitive threats, and emerging trends while quantifying their business impact.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Data Ingestion & Processing
- Handle datasets up to 10M keywords with varying structures (CSV, JSON, database streams)
- Process 100K keywords/minute throughput
- Support real-time streaming and batch processing modes
- Maintain data lineage tracking for audit purposes

### 2. Semantic Analysis Capabilities
- Implement contextual clustering using BERT/GPT embeddings
- Detect semantic relationships between keyword concepts
- Identify emerging topics through anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)
- Quantify sentiment polarity at keyword/cluster level

### 3. Market Intelligence Functions
- **TAM/SAM Analysis**: Calculate serviceable markets using search volume and commercial intent signals
- **Competitive Mapping**: Identify competitors through entity recognition and market share estimation
- **Trend Forecasting**: Predict search volume trajectories using ARIMA/LSTM models
- **Opportunity Scoring**: Algorithm: `(search_volume × intent_commercial × (1 - competition)) / market_saturation`

### 4. Customer Intelligence
- Journey stage classification (awareness, consideration, decision)
- Pain point extraction through syntactic pattern analysis
- Psychographic profiling via keyword semantic networks
- Churn risk prediction using engagement signals

### 5. Technical Specifications
- **Architecture**: Microservices with Kafka event streaming
- **Storage**: Time-series database (InfluxDB) + Graph database (Neo4j)
- **Compute**: Distributed Spark processing with GPU acceleration
- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints with OAuth 2.0 authentication

### 6. Analytical Output Requirements
- Automated report generation (PDF/HTML)
- Interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities
- Alerting system for critical anomalies (p<0.01)
- API-accessible insights in JSON format
- Visualization: Network graphs, heatmaps, forecasting charts

### 7. Quality & Validation
- Implement data quality checks (completeness, consistency, accuracy)
- Establish test datasets with known patterns for validation
- Include confidence scores for all analytical outputs
- Create audit trails for all data transformations

### 8. Scalability & Performance
- Horizontal scaling to handle 10x current load
- <500ms response time for API requests
- 99.95% uptime SLA
- Automated resource scaling based on demand

## Success Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: >90% precision in opportunity identification
2. **Coverage**: Analyze 100% of keywords within 15 minutes
3. **Insight Depth**: Minimum 5 actionable recommendations per report
4. **Business Impact**: Identify opportunities representing >$1M revenue potential
5. **Usability**: <10 minute setup for new dataset analysis

## Deliverable
Generate a comprehensive intelligence report including:
1. Executive summary of key opportunities/threats
2. Market landscape visualization
3. Competitive positioning matrix
4. Customer journey analysis
5. Technical implementation roadmap
6. Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
7. Quantitative opportunity scoring
8. Strategic recommendations with projected ROI

The system should automatically detect data quality issues and request clarification through:
```python
if data_quality_score < 0.8:
    generate_clarification_request(
        problematic_metrics=['completeness', 'freshness'],
        suggested_corrections=['data enrichment', 'realtime streaming']
    )
