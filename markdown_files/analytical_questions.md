# Analytical Questions for Keyword Data

This document provides a structured approach to analyzing the keyword data produced by this pipeline. It's divided into two sections: questions you can ask the data directly, and questions to guide your research in textbooks and other resources.

## Part 1: Questions to Ask Your Data

These questions are designed to help you extract actionable insights from the enriched and clustered keyword data.

### Data Quality and Exploration
- How many keywords were generated in total?
- Are there any missing values for `avg_monthly_searches` or `competition`? If so, why?
- What is the range (min, max) and distribution of `avg_monthly_searches`?
- How many of the original seed keywords are present in the final output?
- Are there any duplicate keywords in the output?

### Foundational Analysis
- What are the top keywords by average monthly searches?
- What are the top keywords by competition level?
- Is there a correlation between search volume and competition? (e.g., do high-volume keywords always have high competition?)
- What is the distribution of competition levels (e.g., what percentage of keywords are low, medium, or high competition)?

### Cluster-Level Analysis
- What are the main thematic clusters in the keyword data?
- What is the total search volume for each cluster?
- What is the average competition level for each cluster?
- Which clusters represent the best opportunities (i.e., high search volume and low competition)?
- Are there any clusters that are surprisingly large or small?

### Strategic Insights
- Which keyword clusters align most closely with our core business offerings?
- Are there any emerging trends or new areas of interest visible in the keyword data?
- What questions are users asking? (Look for clusters of keywords that are phrased as questions).
- What problems are users trying to solve? (Infer this from the intent behind the keyword clusters).

## Part 2: Questions to Ask Textbooks and Research Papers

These questions are designed to help you find new analytical methods and deepen your understanding of the underlying principles.

### Methodological Questions
- What are the most common algorithms for semantic keyword clustering? (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, hierarchical clustering). What are the pros and cons of each?
- How can I evaluate the quality of my keyword clusters? (e.g., silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index).
- What are the best practices for preprocessing text data before generating embeddings? (e.g., lowercasing, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- How can I visualize high-dimensional keyword embeddings and clusters? (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP).

### Theoretical Questions
- How do different sentence transformer models compare in terms of performance for semantic similarity tasks?
- What is the theoretical basis for using embeddings to represent semantic meaning?
- How can I incorporate additional data sources (e.g., SERP data, user behavior data) to enrich my analysis?
- How can I build a predictive model to forecast future search trends based on this data?
- What are the latest techniques for topic modeling, and how do they compare to clustering?
