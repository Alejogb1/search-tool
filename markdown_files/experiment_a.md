Of course. This is an excellent ideaâ€”adapting a formal scientific lab notebook template for a personal psychological experiment adds the necessary rigor and structure.

I've redesigned the template to fit this specific context. I've removed the biological-specific terms and replaced them with concepts relevant to a human behavioral experiment. The new structure guides the user (the "Operator") to think formally about their own behavior, separating hypotheses from observations and protocols from results.

Here is the new Markdown sheet.

# [START DATE] Experiment 001: The Prestige Protocol

## 1. Purpose & Hypothesis

**Purpose:** To empirically validate whether a multi-layered, gamified reward system, modeled after video game reward architecture, can measurably increase consistency and productive output on self-directed, computer-based tasks.

**Hypothesis (H1):** The implementation of the "Prestige Protocol" (Phase B) will result in a statistically significant increase in the frequency of days where the Minimum Viable Effort (MVE) is met, compared to the Baseline (Phase A).

**Hypothesis (H2):** The protocol will lead to a higher average weekly "Quantum of Effort" (QE) count during Phase B compared to Phase A.

## 2. Materials & System Parameters

| **Domain** | **Objective "Prestige" Goal** | **Shorthand** | **Tracking Location** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., Python Studies* | *e.g., Pass AWS ML Certification* | *PY-CERT* | *[Link to Notion/Sheet]* |
| *e.g., Project Coder* | *e.g., Ship v1.0 to 10 beta users* | *PROJ-C* | *[Link to Notion/Sheet]* |
| | | | |

**Core System Parameters:**
*   **Quantum of Effort (QE):** 100 QE per 25-minute focused work session.
*   **Minimum Viable Effort (MVE):** 250 QE per 24-hour cycle.
*   **Data Source(s):** Manual logging via spreadsheet, time-tracking software (e.g., Toggl), automated scripts (e.g., git commit hooks).

## 3. Daily Log: Notes & Subjective Observations

*This section is for qualitative, daily journaling. Note feelings, friction points, moments of high motivation, and unexpected events. Use a new entry for each day.*

**[YYYY-MM-DD] | Phase: A1 | Day: 1**
*   **Subjective Motivation (1-10):**
*   **Observations:** [e.g., "Felt significant friction starting the PY-CERT study session. Distracted by email. Total productive time was lower than intended."]

**[YYYY-MM-DD] | Phase: B | Day: 29**
*   **Subjective Motivation (1-10):**
*   **Accolades Unlocked:**
*   **Observations:** [e.g., "Hit a wall on PROJ-C bug. Felt demotivated, but the desire to maintain the 15-day streak was enough to push me to complete one more QE session on PY-CERT to meet the MVE. The system worked as a safety net today."]

## 4. Summary of Results (To be completed post-experiment)

*This section will contain the final quantitative analysis and data visualizations after all phases are complete.*

**Key Metrics Comparison (Phase A vs. Phase B):**
*   **Consistency Rate (Days MVE Met / Total Days):**
*   **Average Weekly QE Output:**
*   **Average Subjective Motivation Score:**
*   **Streak Analysis (Max Streak, Avg. Length):**

**Visualizations:**

## 5. Experimental Protocol

**Phase A: Baseline Establishment (Duration: 2-4 Weeks)**

1.  At the start of each workday, define primary tasks for the tracked **Domains**.
2.  Work is performed as normal, without any gamified feedback.
3.  All work sessions are to be logged diligently using the designated tracking tools, recording **Time Spent** and **Task Description**.
4.  At the end of each 24-hour cycle, complete a **Daily Log** entry, recording the **Subjective Motivation** score and qualitative **Observations**.
5.  There is no concept of "streak" or "MVE" during this phase; data is collected purely for baseline comparison.

**Phase B: Intervention - The Prestige Protocol (Duration: 4-8 Weeks)**

1.  Protocol continues from Phase A, with the following additions.
2.  The **Minimum Viable Effort (MVE)** of 250 QE is now the daily target. A day is marked as "Success" if MVE is achieved.
3.  **Streaks** are tracked and displayed prominently.
4.  After each work session, **Quantum of Effort (QE)** is calculated and logged.
5.  At the end of each day, the **Daily Log** is updated, now including any **Accolades Unlocked**.
6.  The Operator must review their progress (current level, XP bar, streak) at least once per day to ensure the feedback loop is active.

**Phase A2 (Optional): Reversal/Withdrawal (Duration: 2 Weeks)**

1.  The gamified system (streaks, QE, accolades) is turned off completely.
2.  The protocol reverts to the same conditions as the initial **Phase A**.
3.  Data collection continues as normal. The purpose is to observe if performance metrics revert to baseline levels, which would provide stronger evidence for the system's causal impact.

**Data Handling:**

1.  All raw data from tracking tools will be compiled into a master CSV file.
2.  At the end of the experiment, the data will be analyzed using statistical methods (e.g., t-tests) to compare the means of key metrics between phases.
3.  Scripts used for analysis and visualization will be stored in the `/scripts` directory.
4.  Final charts and summary tables will be embedded in the **Summary of Results** section.
