    Validates search terms against quality criteria:
    - Commercial intent
    - Search volume potential
    - Relevance to offerings
    """
    criteria = {
        'min_word_count': 2,
        'max_word_count': 5,
        'allowed_chars': r"[a-zA-Z0-9\s'-]",
        'banned_patterns': [
            r".*:.*",  # No colons
            r"Â¿.*\?",  # No explicit questions
            r".*\d{4}"  # No years/dates
        ]
    }
    # Validation logic would go here
```
