# SCOPE Model Prompts

## Signal Extraction Prompt
**Objective:** Extract the explicit, surface-level meaning from search terms by identifying key entities, actions, and modifiers.

### Instructions:
Analyze the following search term and identify:
1. Primary entities (nouns, proper nouns)
2. Core actions (verbs, verb phrases)
3. Modifiers (adjectives, adverbs, quantifiers)
4. Grammatical structure (syntax pattern)
5. Literal interpretation (denotative meaning)

### Analysis Framework:
- **Entity Identification:** Tag all concrete and abstract nouns
- **Action Mapping:** Connect verbs to their subject-object relationships
- **Modifier Analysis:** Categorize descriptors (quality, quantity, intensity)
- **Syntax Parsing:** Diagram sentence structure using dependency grammar
- **Denotation Extraction:** State literal meaning without interpretation

### Example:
**Term:** "affordable wireless noise-canceling headphones"
- Entities: headphones (concrete noun)
- Actions: [implied] purchase/use
- Modifiers: affordable (price), wireless (feature), noise-canceling (feature)
- Syntax: [Adjective] [Adjective] [Adjective] [Noun]
- Literal: Headphones that cancel noise, work wirelessly, and are low-cost

### Output Format:
```json
{
  "term": "original phrase",
  "entities": ["list", "of", "nouns"],
  "actions": ["implied", "verbs"],
  "modifiers": {
    "type": ["adjectives"],
    "feature": ["descriptors"],
    "price": ["terms"],
    "intensity": ["adverbs"]
  },
  "syntax_pattern": "syntactic structure",
  "literal_meaning": "plain English explanation"
}
```

## Context Inference Prompt
**Objective:** Infer situational, temporal, and cultural context surrounding search terms.

### Instructions:
Analyze the following search term and identify:
1. Situational context (immediate circumstances)
2. Temporal context (time-related factors)
3. Cultural context (societal norms/trends)
4. Domain-specific context (industry/field implications)
5. Contextual triggers (implied events or needs)

### Analysis Framework:
- **Situational Analysis:** What scenario would prompt this search?
- **Temporal Markers:** Time sensitivity indicators (urgent, seasonal, etc.)
- **Cultural Signifiers:** Regional, generational, or subcultural cues
- **Domain Relevance:** Professional or specialized knowledge domains
- **Trigger Mapping:** Implied problems or events driving the search

### Example:
**Term:** "emergency plumber weekend rates"
- Situational: Home plumbing emergency during non-business hours
- Temporal: Weekend-specific, urgent time sensitivity
- Cultural: Urban living with 24/7 service expectations
- Domain: Home services industry, emergency repairs
- Trigger: Pipe burst or severe leak requiring immediate attention

### Output Format:
```json
{
  "term": "original phrase",
  "situational_context": ["scenario", "description"],
  "temporal_context": {
    "time_sensitivity": "urgent/seasonal/planning",
    "time_of_day": "night/day",
    "seasonality": "if applicable"
  },
  "cultural_context": ["norms", "trends"],
  "domain_context": ["industry", "field"],
  "implicit_triggers": ["event", "problem"]
}
```

## Objective Identification Prompt
**Objective:** Uncover the searcher's fundamental goals, needs, and desired outcomes.

### Instructions:
Analyze the following search term and identify:
1. Primary goals (explicit objectives)
2. Secondary objectives (implied needs)
3. Task orientation (information seeking vs. action oriented)
4. Outcome expectations (desired end state)
5. Goal complexity (simple vs. multi-stage objectives)

### Analysis Framework:
- **Goal Hierarchy:** Distinguish between surface-level and fundamental needs
- **Task Analysis:** Classify as navigational, informational, transactional
- **Outcome Mapping:** Describe ideal resolution state
- **Complexity Assessment:** Evaluate multi-step objective requirements
- **Need Articulation:** Translate implied needs into explicit statements

### Example:
**Term:** "compare mutual funds with low fees"
- Primary Goal: Identify optimal investment vehicle
- Secondary Objective: Minimize financial costs
- Task Orientation: Informational (research) â†’ Transactional (investment)
- Outcome: Selection of best-performing low-fee fund
- Complexity: Medium (requires comparison analysis)

### Output Format:
```json
{
  "term": "original phrase",
  "primary_goal": "main objective",
  "secondary_objectives": ["list", "of", "implied", "needs"],
  "task_type": "informational/transactional/navigational",
  "desired_outcome": "end state description",
  "complexity_level": "low/medium/high"
}
```
