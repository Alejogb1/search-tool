## 1. Abstract & Rationale

**Abstract:** This research investigates the efficacy of transposing the reward system architecture from the video game *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2* (2009) to a personal productivity framework. The study aims to measure the impact of gamified feedback loops—including XP, levels, prestige, streaks, and contextual achievements ("Accolades")—on user consistency, output, and subjective motivation for long-term, non-recreational tasks.

**Rationale:** Many productive tasks lack the immediate, variable-ratio reinforcement schedules that make video games compelling. This study hypothesizes that by artificially constructing such a system, we can "bootstrap" motivation and habit formation, particularly for tasks with delayed gratification.

## 2. Research Questions & Hypotheses

**Primary Question:** Can a gamified reward system modeled after MW2 measurably increase an individual's daily consistency and total output on self-directed, computer-based tasks?

**Hypotheses:**
*   **H1 (Consistency):** The implementation of the system will lead to a statistically significant increase in the frequency of days where a minimum work threshold is met.
*   **H2 (Output):** The system will lead to a statistically significant increase in the total volume of work completed (measured in time or task units) per week.
*   **H3 (Resilience):** The system's "Accolades" for overcoming failure (e.g., "Comeback," "Revenge") will correlate with shorter periods of inactivity following a missed day or a failed task.
*   **H4 (Subjective Motivation):** Self-reported motivation scores will be significantly higher during the intervention phase, particularly on days of low intrinsic drive.

## 3. Methodology

**Design:** Single-Subject, A-B-A Reversal Design.
*   **Phase A1 (4 Weeks):** Baseline data collection. No system in place.
*   **Phase B (8 Weeks):** Intervention. Full implementation of the MW2 Reward Model.
*   **Phase A2 (4 Weeks):** Withdrawal/Reversal. The system is removed to test for lingering effects and dependency.

**Participant(s):** N=1 (Self-Experimentation)

**Independent Variable:** The MW2-modeled reward system.
*   **Components:** XP per unit of effort, levels, prestige mechanic, daily streaks, Accolade/Medal system.

**Dependent Variables (Metrics):**
*   **Quantitative:**
    *   Daily Productive Time (minutes).
    *   Daily Task Completion Count.
    *   Streak Length (days).
    *   Time-to-Restart after a broken streak (hours).
    *   Frequency of Accolade Unlocks.
*   **Qualitative:**
    *   Daily Motivation Score (1-10 Likert scale).
    *   Daily Friction/Anxiety Score (1-10 Likert scale).
    *   End-of-day journal entry (1-3 sentences on subjective experience).

**Data Collection Instrument:** Digital Spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets, Notion) or a custom-built web application.

## 4. Potential Deep Learning Implementation Areas

*   **Dynamic XP Calibration:**
    *   An RNN or LSTM model trained on past performance data (time taken, task type, self-reported difficulty) to dynamically predict and assign an appropriate XP value for new, unseen tasks.
*   **Personalized "Accolade" Generation:**
    *   A reinforcement learning (RL) agent that identifies patterns in user behavior (e.g., consistent work at a certain time of day, overcoming a specific type of difficult task) and proposes new, personalized "Accolades" to maximize long-term engagement.
*   **Predictive Burnout Detection:**
    *   A classifier (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) trained on metrics (declining XP/day, increased time on simple tasks, negative sentiment in journal entries) to predict a high probability of burnout or streak abandonment. It could trigger a "System Alert" suggesting a rest day or a lower daily goal.
*   **Optimal Task Scheduling:**
    *   An RL model that suggests the next task to work on from a to-do list, optimizing for a combination of project priority and maintaining user motivation (e.g., suggesting a "quick win" task after a long, difficult one).
