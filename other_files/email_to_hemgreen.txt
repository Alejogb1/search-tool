Subject: Found Relevant Use Case for Azlon - Keyword Analysis Intelligence Layer

Hem,

I've identified a compelling use case for Azlon while working on the search-tool project. The system currently generates output keywords (see attached output-keywords.csv) but lacks an intelligence layer to analyze and cluster them effectively.

Technical Context:
- The project processes search data through multiple stages (extraction, enrichment, clustering)
- Current clustering uses HDBSCAN (hdbscan_.ipynb) but needs autonomous optimization
- Core services architecture (analysis_orchestrator.py, keyword_clusterer.py) provides integration points

Why this matters for Azlon:
1. Demonstrates real-world need for autonomous data science workflows
2. Requires exactly Azlon's capabilities - generating, testing and refining analysis code
3. Provides concrete example of "intelligence layer" you mentioned needing to build

The workflow would be:
1. User provides raw keyword data
2. Azlon autonomously:
   - Analyzes semantic relationships
   - Optimizes clustering parameters
   - Validates cluster quality
   - Generates actionable insights

This directly addresses the "accuracy cannot be trusted" concern from data scientists by:
- Implementing validation checks at each step
- Providing explainable metrics
- Allowing human override when needed

Would this be valuable to discuss further? I can prepare a more detailed technical proposal.

Best,
