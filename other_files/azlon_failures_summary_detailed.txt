Based on the evaluation criteria from `azlon_response_metrics.md`, here is a summary of the biggest failures from the test run:

1.  **Dependency Management Failure (Dimension A: Code Quality):** The agent failed the 'Dependency Mgmt.' metric. The generated Dockerfile was incomplete because it lacked the necessary system-level compilers (like gcc) required to build the `hdbscan` Python package. This was the root cause of the entire process failure.

2.  **Zero Error Recovery (Dimension C: Autonomous Process Efficiency):** The agent scored 0% on the 'Error Recovery Rate'. Its autonomous refinement loop could not diagnose or fix the environment-level build error. It gave up after three iterations without understanding that the problem was a missing system dependency, not a flaw in the Python code itself.

3.  **Complete Failure on Core Objectives (Dimensions B & D):** Because the code never successfully built or ran, all metrics under 'Clustering & Analysis Quality' and 'Prompt Adherence' were complete failures. The agent did not produce any clusters, statistical analysis, or insights, failing to meet the primary goal of the prompt.
